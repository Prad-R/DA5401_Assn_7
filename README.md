# Problem Statement

The primary goal is to perform model selection by comparing various classifier types. We will use ROC and PRC analysis, adapted for the multi-class setting, to determine the best-performing and worst-performing models, paying special attention to the performance across different decision thresholds.

The task at hand is classifying based on the UCI Landsat Satellite dataset.

This is what is done in the notebook `Assn_7.ipynb`.
